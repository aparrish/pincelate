    "This notebook shows you how to use [Pincelate](https://pincelate.readthedocs.io/) and how to do some interesting things with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pincelate is a Python library that provides a simple interface for a machine learning model that can sound out English words and spell English words based on how they sound. \"Sounding out\" here means converting letters (\"orthography\") to sounds (\"phonemes\"), and \"spelling\" means converting sounds to letters (phonemes to orthography). The model is trained on the [CMU Pronouncing Dictionary](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict), which means it generally sounds words out as though speaking \"standard\" North American English, and spells words according to \"standard\" North American English rules (at least as far as the model itself is accurate).\n",

    "    pip install pincelate\n",
    "    \n",
    "(Installing Pincelate will also install Pronouncing, which we'll use at various points in the experiments below.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Other libraries you'll need for this notebook: `numpy` and `scipy`. If you're using Anaconda, you already have these libraries. If not, install them like so:\n",
